  # Lists Practice #1
  # Print the following list on the screen:
  # ["Python", "is", "easy", "to", "learn"]

  # Lists Practice #1
  # Create a list with 5 elements, inside the variable my_list. You can include strings, booleans, numbers, etc.

  # Lists Practice #2
  # Add the element "motorcycle" to the following list of means of transportation:
  # transportation_means = ["plane", "car", "ship", "bicycle"]
  # You must not modify the already supplied line of code, but must use the appropriate list method to add a new element.

  # Lists Practice #3
  # Use the pop() method to remove the third item from the following list called fruits, and store it in a variable called deleted_item. Use list methods without altering the line of code already supplied.
  # apple
  # banana
  # mango
  # cherry
  # watermelon
